# Group Project \- API Testing

For your group project, you have been asked by an imaginary client to help solve a \[insert your choice\] problem. You are allowed to use any Public API that is available to you, a great list of Publicly Available API’s are available [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) \- **I recommend using ones that with have No Auth or API Key Auth**/  
As part of this Group Project, one of the most difficult parts is being able to ensure that your APIs are working. The point of the this Deliverable is for you to layout your pages and the API’s that will be used to be able to provide data to the pages.  
We want to make sure that you are able to get Data from the API.

### **API Mapping \- 20 pts**

* Create a List of the Pages you are going to Create and what data you will show  
* List the API’s which you will leverage to show the data on the page  
  * Explain what the API does

### **API Results \- 30 pts**

* Make Insomnia Calls to the API(s) that you will use  
* Show that you are able to get the data you desire  
* Take Screenshots of the Request \+ Response showing the data for each API
