# Project Proposal

For your project, you have been asked by an imaginary client to help solve a \[insert your choice\] problem. You are allowed to use any Public API that is available to you, a great list of Publicly Available APIâ€™s are available [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) \- **I recommend using ones that with have No Auth or API Key Auth**, Oauth may be complex to setup, your group will be expected to define a problem, consider the stakeholders for the problem, and design a solution for your stakeholders using front-end web technologies that access and make use of public data API.

This project is intended to mimic the production of a contemporary dynamic web application. As such, it has two separate development sections

* Front End, which will be used to display information and solve an information problem  
* Back end, which will be used to get Data from a Database and supply Data to Front-End

While composing your project, you will be expected to make technical and people-oriented justifications for your use of technical tools, software libraries, and supporting systems. These are expected to appear in your presentation and documentation, as human communication about technology is key to being understood in the professional world.

## A Note On Partner Work Grading

Although all partner work is graded by group, the instructor for this course retains the ability to zero out a grade for any student whose contribution to the group work is seen to be low or minimal.

# Proposal

This project is intended to mimic the following steps of a professional web development system:

* Deciding on a data set to address  
* Deciding what your application will be communicating with that data  
* Designing a back-end API that will translate data from an external source to your application  
* Designing a front-end web application to communicate with your server and display your information using an attractive and interesting method of data visualization

## Required Proposal Sections

The proposal you present should have the following 4 things, outlined with the requirements below:

1. Problem Statement (50 pts)  
2. Technology Decisions (30 pts)  
3. Initial Wireframes (20 pts)

### **Problem (50 pts)**

* What is the problem you're hoping to solve?  
* Who are the people who care about this problem (the stakeholders \- could be a group of people or a company or the general public)?  
* How would your proposed system solve the information problem?  
* Explain which API(s) you've chosen to work with, and why (what's your information problem)?  
  * Provide the *exact* API that you will be using  
* A description of the front-end technology you expect to use to make your application  
* Choose an open API from [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) (you are free to use ones not on here, just run it by me please)

### **Technology Decisions (30 pts)**

Your project will require you to make an API on both the backend and frontend, so it is important to break down what elements you will utilize. You will also be required to account for having a database, and some integration between these.

* HTML/CSS? React? Pure Javascript? SCSS?  
* What frameworks will you be using to author your front end? \- You may not know the exact answer, but you should try to articulate what elements you want on the page and we can decide on the exact frameworks later\!  
* How will you leverage the Database in your project? \- This means how will you utilize the storage of data to provide something for your API

### **Initial Wireframes (20 pts)**

You are required to have considered the following elements

* Your main \+ home page \- what will it look like?  
* An About page that defines the project and tells people what to expect, and a little bit about your information problem  
* A help page that covers how to use your application to best effect  
* AI can be used, would love to see some AI Mockups\!

Goal:

* Very rough Mockups \- Can be hand drawn, just to explain the Layout
